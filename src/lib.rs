//! Tools for reading data types of arbitrary bit length and might not be byte-aligned in the source data
//!
//! The main way of handling with the binary data is to first create a [`BitReadBuffer`]
//! ,wrap it into a [`BitReadStream`] and then read from the stream.
//!
//! Once you have a BitStream, there are 2 different approaches of reading data
//!
//! - read primitives, Strings and byte arrays, using [`read_bool`], [`read_int`], [`read_float`], [`read_bytes`] and [`read_string`]
//! - read any type implementing the  [`BitRead`] or [`BitReadSized`] traits using [`read`] and [`read_sized`]
//!   - [`BitRead`] is for types that can be read without requiring any size info (e.g. null-terminal strings, floats, whole integers, etc)
//!   - [`BitReadSized`] is for types that require external sizing information to be read (fixed length strings, arbitrary length integers
//!
//! The [`BitRead`] and [`BitReadSized`] traits can be used with `#[derive]` if all fields implement [`BitRead`] or [`BitReadSized`].
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # use bitbuffer::Result;
//! use bitbuffer::{BitReadBuffer, LittleEndian, BitReadStream, BitRead};
//!
//! #[derive(BitRead)]
//! struct ComplexType {
//!     first: u8,
//!     #[size = 15]
//!     second: u16,
//!     third: bool,
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let bytes = vec![
//!     0b1011_0101, 0b0110_1010, 0b1010_1100, 0b1001_1001,
//!     0b1001_1001, 0b1001_1001, 0b1001_1001, 0b1110_0111
//! ];
//! let buffer = BitReadBuffer::new(bytes, LittleEndian);
//! let mut stream = BitReadStream::new(buffer);
//! let value: u8 = stream.read_int(7)?;
//! let complex: ComplexType = stream.read()?;
//! #
//! #     Ok(())
//! # }
